  Required Installations:
1. Python Environment

Python 3.11 (or latest stable 3.x version)

pip (Python package installer)

2. Code Editor

Visual Studio Code (latest stable version)

4. Google Chrome (version 137.0.7151.119)

5. ChromeDriver (matching the exact Chrome version installed)
If possible, please install ChromeDriver 137.0.7151.119 to match Chrome v137.0.7151.119.

Alternatively, since weâ€™ll use webdriver-manager in Python, ensuring Chrome is up to date and accessible is enough, 
as webdriver-manager can download and manage the appropriate driver automatically.
